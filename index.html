			 <section> <!-- How Computers Think -->
				 <h2>How Computers Think</h2>
				 <p>
					 Computers have three types of memory &mdash; <strong class="blue">Read-Only Memory</strong>,
					 <strong class="blue">Hard Drive Memory</strong>, and <strong class="blue">Random Access Memory</strong>.
				 </p>

				 <aside class="notes">
					 ... once digital computers arrived, the base on which computers did
					 all of their thinking, colloquially referred to as “memory,” stabilized
					 into three forms, . It operates a little differently from human memory,
					 but I'll try to make it as clear as possible.
				 </aside>
			 </section>

			 <section> <!-- How Do Computers Do Their Thinking: ROM -->
				 <h2>How Computers Think: ROM</h2>
				 <p>
					 <strong class="blue">ROM</strong>, or <strong class="blue">Read-Only Memory</strong>, is hardwritten
					 into chips and handles data essential to a computer's operation.
				 </p>

				 <aside class="notes">
					 ROM, or read-only memory, is memory that’s hardwritten onto chips. This kind of
					 memory is typically responsible for serving up the kind of data that’s your
					 computer would be hard-pressed to operate without — like an operating system.
					 Of course, making it quick to access means that files in it can’t be edited,
					 and means that your computer won’t forget how to operate when it’s turned off.

					 Do we have any gamers in our midst? Or been down to 16-Bit?
				 </aside>
			 </section>
			 <section>
				 <h2 class="has-text-align-center">How Computers Think: ROM</h2>

				 <small style="display: block;" class="fragment">(I'm sorry...)</small>
			 </section>

			 <aside class="notes">
				 In a computer, it operates a bit like your brain stem — taking care of activities
				 that are necessary to life so you don’t have to spend all of your thinking on
				 performing them, like breathing. I am sorry if you are now thinking about breathing
				 and actively doing it right now.
			 </aside>

		 <!-- How Do Computers Do Their Thinking: Hard Drive Memory -->

			 <section>
				 <h2>How Computers Think: <br>Hard Drive Memory</h2>
				 <p>
					 <strong class="blue">Hard Drive Memory</strong> is editable memory that
					 holds files and programs that you create and install.
				 </p>

				 <aside class="notes">
					 Hard drive memory — not explicitly named as memory, but still, technically memory, holds files and
					 programs on your computer that you create and install. While ROM is fixed, memory on your hard drive
					 can be written and edited, which makes it very much like long-term memory. When you “save” files,
					 you’re writing them to your hard drive. Flash drives, similarly, are a type of hard drive memory.

				 <aside class="notes">
					 The human analogue of this type of computer memory is long-term

								Yup. In programming languages, a single equal sign is used to assign values

								Additionally, the exclamation point in front of an equal sign is the programming
								equivalent of not equal to. "And" will run code if both listed conditions are true,
